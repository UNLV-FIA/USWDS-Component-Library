## Library Contribution

### Steps to Contribute

1. **Select a Component**
Choose a component from the official **USWDS component library** that has **not already been implemented** in `ngx-uswds-lib`.
- Check existing components and open pull requests to avoid duplication.

2. **Create a Feature Branch**
Create a new branch dedicated **only** to the selected component.
- Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feature/accordion`, `component/alert`).

3. **Create the Component Directory**
In the `src/components` directory, create a new folder for your component.
- The folder name **must match the component name** as listed on the USWDS website.

4. **Implement the Component**
- Reference the **official USWDS component documentation and source code** throughout development.
- Ensure the Angular component:
- Matches USWDS structure and behavior
- Supports **all variants, states, and configurations** listed on the USWDS website
- Follows existing `ngx-uswds-lib` coding patterns and conventions

5. **Verify and Test**
- Confirm visual and functional parity with the USWDS examples
- Add or update tests and documentation as needed

6. **Submit a Pull Request**
- Open a pull request targeting the main development branch
- Clearly describe:
- The implemented component
- Supported variations
- Any deviations from the USWDS reference (if applicable)
